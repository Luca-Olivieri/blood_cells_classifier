# Blood Cells Classification

As part of the 2024 edition of First Challenge of the **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** (AN2DL) course at Politecnico di Milano, this project focused on classifying blood cell images by type using deep learning.

Leveraging a smart use of state-of-the-art architectures, advanced techniques and refined image augmentation strategies, the model achieved **96.87%** accuracy on the private, heavily corrupted test set, showcasing exceptional robustness and generalisation capabilities. 

As a result, our efforts earned the **first place** among 192 teams, composed by 693 students.

The model is available in the following publicly accessible Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bq_QaO7tJCUSrWf_rgvnramoZsl5gWIU/view?usp=share_link).
